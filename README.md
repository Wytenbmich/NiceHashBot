##What does NiceHashBot do?

Profit calculator uses the NiceHash hashpower marketplace to buy hashpower.

It is only profitable to buy hashpower when the difficulty of mining is lower enough so the cost of buying hashpower is cheaper than the cost of mining.

##When does this occur?

Throughout the mining difficulty will fluctuate allowing for a profit to be acquired during certain periods.

However during some periods there is no profit so the amount of hashpower requested should be kept at a minimum.

The minimum order rate is 0.1 TH/s (Depending on the algo) so should be set when there is no profit.

Otherwise higher rate should be set to take all the available hashpower on the market.

#Notes
This program will no longer work due to the high competition in market causing razor thin margins and other users willing to mine at a loss for other reasons aside from pure profit based motives.
